# postatees-studio

## Getting Started

### Setting up your repository

If you're setting up this project in a new location, follow these steps:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
# Example: cd /home/claude
cd /path/to/your/project

# Add your GitHub repo as remote (if not already configured)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/postatees-studio.git

# Rename branch to main and push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username or organization name, and `/path/to/your/project` with your actual project path (e.g., `/home/claude`).

If the remote `origin` already exists, use `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/postatees-studio.git` instead.
