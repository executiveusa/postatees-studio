## Getting Started

### Setting Up GitHub Repository

If you've cloned this repository locally and want to push it to your own GitHub account, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to your project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/postatees-studio
   ```

2. **Add your GitHub repository as remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/postatees-studio.git
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

3. **Rename your branch to main:**
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

This will set up your local repository to track the remote repository on GitHub and push your initial commit.
